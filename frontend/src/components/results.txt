        prevention: `Regular Monitoring. Remove Weeds. Plant Resistant Varieties. Mulching. Control Ants.`,

        treatment: 'Fungicide applications can help control Black Sigatoka, but the disease has developed resistance to some chemicals. Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent resistance.',
        prevention: 'Remove and destroy infected leaves to reduce the source of fungal spores. Use resistant or tolerant banana varieties if available. Ensure proper plant spacing to allow air circulation and reduce humidity. Apply foliar sprays with fungicides (e.g., strobilurins, triazoles). Implement cultural practices like pruning and de-leafing to reduce disease spread.',
        riskSeason: 'Rainy Season: The spread of Black Sigatoka is favored by high humidity and frequent rain, which help spores spread and germinate on wet leaf surfaces.'

        prevention: 'Avoid injury to the plants, as the bacterium enters through wounds. Ensure good drainage to reduce wet conditions that promote bacterial growth. Remove and destroy infected plant tissues. Maintain proper plant spacing for adequate air circulation. Sterilize tools and equipment between uses to avoid spreading the bacteria.',

        prevention: 'Use disease-resistant varieties (though the Cavendish is highly susceptible). Implement strict sanitation measures, such as cleaning tools and machinery after working in infected fields. Apply crop rotation with non-host crops like rice or maize to reduce pathogen levels in the soil. Maintain good drainage to prevent waterlogging and reduce disease severity. Biosecurity practices to prevent movement of contaminated soil and plant material.',
